	<h1>Kate's Portfolio - Home</h1>
	<p>This website is a work in progress, a first draft of a portfolio site that will eventually live at www.kate.codes
	<br>
	I am currently a web development student at Dev Bootcamp, and as I expand my skills this website will improve and get ever closer to a portfolio/resume site I can be proud of.
